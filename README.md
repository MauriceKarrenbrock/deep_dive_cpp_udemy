# Exercises of: Learn C++ Programming -Beginner to Advance- Deep Dive in C++
## A C++ Udemy course

This are the exercises that I did during the Udemy course [Learn C++ Programming -Beginner to Advance- Deep Dive in C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-deep-dive/)
They are divided by topics, most of them are small exercises to learn the basics, except for the final project (contained in the directory final\_project\_banking\_system/).

### Final project description

For the final project we had to create a banking system, where the user can create, remove and manage various bank accounts, and the program must have a backup system in place in order to remember the bank accounts created in previos runs.
I created a Bank class that is a countainer of BankAccount classes, every BankAccount has a unique account number that can be used to identify it.
The user interface is robust to bad user input and will communicate the problem to the user and ask for a new input.
